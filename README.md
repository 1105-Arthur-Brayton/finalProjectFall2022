# Attack of the Cubes

This videogame is intented to be a continuously more difficult and exciting game of racing the clock. With further development, this game will be perfect for scoreboards, glitch-abusers, and speedrunner.com followers.

## Description

Attack of the Cubes is the embodiment of exponentiality. It may start slowly, but don't fret; this game will get away from you if you can't keep your feet under you. With speed as your ally, you must bounce around fluidly, always keeping the next step in mind. Further updates may include other game modes, such as seeing how many points you can get in a certain time limit. Attack of the Cubes is an interesting take on the classic platformer style that incorporates modern gaming trends, such as leaderboards in coming updates.

## Help

Because of the fast-paced nature of this game, a large amount of my focus was to iron out bugs and heavily comment through my code. I will have to ask some fresh pairs of eyes for input on what they might not find clear.
